# Single-spa Study

Single-spa study. I created three micro-frontend applications and the root-config, application that register the other applications.

Applications:

- [root-config](https://github.com/gabrielburich/single-spa-study/tree/main/root-config) Registry the other applications
- [main-page](https://github.com/gabrielburich/single-spa-study/tree/main/main-page) A div with a label
- [second-page](https://github.com/gabrielburich/single-spa-study/tree/main/seccond-page) Other div with a label
- [nav-bar](https://github.com/gabrielburich/single-spa-study/tree/main/nav-bar) A menu

How to run:

1. All Services: run `yarn start` on each directory
2. Standalone: run `yarn start:standalone` on a micro-frontend

TODO:

- [ ] Create a production structure with build and docker images
